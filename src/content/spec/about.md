# About

こんにちは, **イロン**（**YiRong**）です, you can also call me by my nick name **KardeniaPoyu**, **鹿茸栀子粥**. I am currently an undergraduate student majoring in Information and Computing Science from China, and I hope to study, work, and live in Japan someday.  
My academic interests include  `computer graphics` ,  `AI` ,  `game development`  and every application of mathematics in computer science.  

In addition to my studies, I enjoy developing personal projects, such as creating my own blog, experimenting with game design, and learning new programming frameworks.

When I’m not coding, I enjoy Games (PC or console), reading or writing some novels, focusing politics, history and intercultural exchange, playing my guiter. In a word, things related to art and philosophy.

Through this blog, I hope to document my learning process, share insights, and connect with others who share similar interests.  If you find something useful here or would like to collaborate, please feel free to reach out and be my friend. 

Please note that my blog and my connections are based on the following languages.

| Language     | preference                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `English`       | currently the main language of my blog , as it is smoother for me to communicate before my Japanese proficiency improves further                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `日本語`   | I am doing my best to learn Japanese, and I hope to make it the language I use most in my daily life                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `简体中文` | my native language                      

_Fun facts about me: I am a DEVOTED Kirby fan cuz Kirby is cute but powerful. I can’t stand secondhand smoke🚬, I value freedom of speech📰, and I really care about work-life balance💴 and minority rights🌈_.
